# Table of contents

Adding a table of contents is a great way to
add more context and easier navigation for
long documents. With MDX, you can add a table
of contents as a component or remark plugin.

A component-based implementation is ultimately
more flexible since you can apply it at the
document level or in a layout. This is useful
for adding the table of contents to the right
hand side of a document which you often see
on documentation sites.

The plugin-based approach isn't much more than
installing a plugin and configuring it!

## Plugin

Install [`remark-toc`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc):

```sh
yarn add remark-toc
```

Then, configure it as a `remarkPlugin`:

```js
remarkPlugins: [require('remark-toc')]
```

Lastly, add a table of contents header:

```md
# Hello, world!

## Table of contents

<!-- This will be magically populated by remark-toc -->

## Other

## Headings...
```

## Component
